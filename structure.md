3. introduction
    - introduce preliminary/ basic observations
        1. Food riots are rather unsuccessful: Limited correlation between food prices and food riots
    - pose main question
        1. If food riots are "unsuccessful" why bother?
    - build an argument:
        + on the basis of the second observation that  food riots seem to follow a pattern<!--  / form a repertoire -->, I argue that food riots are a repertoire and part of the political negotiation of the legitimacy of political authority. There purpose is to introduce some long-term stability into bread / food prices instead of securing instant reduction in prices.
    - introduce sources
    - introduce method
3. prices and food economy
4. Legal questions (necessary?)
5. the repertoire

        + no food riot in July 1910 in Beirut
        + 1880 Damascus: direct looting of bread
        + 1910 Aleppo: direct attack on a named merchant
