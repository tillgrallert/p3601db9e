    Charles Tilly’s research group coined the term “repertoires of contention” for their research on 18th and 19th-century Britain, defining repertoires as “a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice”, which are then used in contentions, or “bounded interactions in the course of which linked sets of people make claims on individuals or sets of individuals outside their own number”; {Tilly 1993@264}, {Tilly 1987@227}; see also {Tilly 2008}.

    Following Charles Tilly's work, I define *food riots* as contentious collective action: a group of people assemble in a public place and raise the demand of lower food prices vis-à-vis another group of people.[^1] All case studies in this research project must conform to this basic definition of a specific *form* of action as well as a specific contentious *claim*. Based on empirical case studies I argue that such food riots form a *repertoire of contention* or "a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice".[^2]
