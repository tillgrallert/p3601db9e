# Important

- Formalities: c.10000 words; English spellings, full footnotes, no additional bibliography, consistent transliteration (IJMES or Iranian Studies)
- mention that the choreography and public ritual of food riots is at the core of my paper. I do not want to explain why food riots happened at a particular moment
- comment on the significance of locations:
    + Hama: events take place all across the town with main sites of action being at opposite ends of the city.
    + Homs: events take place across the city and groups of protestors and law enforcement repeatedly cross the city
- the plots might need some annotation
- comment on the relevance of women for this study
- comment on neither form nor claim being commented on as unusual by contemporaneous sources.
- comment that newspapers are the common source for most research on contentious politics and the most important event catalogues

- further comment on absence of food riots between 1880 and 1908
    + comment on standard view on press censorship in this period
- "Peace and tranquillity as the defining basis of Ottoman political legitimacy—asāyiş-i ʿumūmī or al-rāḥa al-ʿumūmiyya—" this requires a footnote
- is the main question referred to throughout the paper?
- Do we face a similar developments [protest against market economy] in the context of the current study? Do I pose/ answer this question? 

- mention the choreography and public ritual of food riots
- significance of food riots for protest movements
    + what are other forms and how frequent are they
- integrate concept / term of "subsistence crisis"

## technicalities

- use absolute links to images etc. to support hypothes.is


## bits and pieces

If we focus on individual food riots and compare different as contentious performances, we discover that they share a limited repertoire of claims and actions
to the extent that one could speak of a shared script. 


This repertoire is different from what Tilly conceptualised as a repertoire of 

## done

- use dataset  for the argument in the section on food prices: I am not sure what I meant by this statement
    + **done** in [^fn12]: mention that the data set and all plots are available with DOI from Zenodo
    + **done** #td10: make sure to use a consistent number of food riots: 
        * 2018-10-13: 26 food riots between 1874--1916, including 7 in Baghdad
- **done** add static maps
    + of all food riots in my sample
- **done** integrate qualitative price data
- add references to the dataset
- change structure:
    + move vignettes to the front of the "food riots" sections
- ask Yvonne if and how to reference maps: probably not
    + add references to the maps
- mention Gelvin in the context of models for and of society
- footnote on "politics of notables". probably from thesis.
- introduction
- #Td4: point to a table or data set on food riots
- #Td5: write outline of paper
- #Td6: first footnote on weights and measures. The notes have been written and need to be placed after editing.
- #Td9: first footnote on repertoire of contention

    Charles Tilly’s research group coined the term “repertoires of contention” for their research on 18th and 19th-century Britain, defining repertoires as “a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice”, which are then used in contentions, or “bounded interactions in the course of which linked sets of people make claims on individuals or sets of individuals outside their own number”; {Tilly 1993@264}, {Tilly 1987@227}; see also {Tilly 2008}.

    Following Charles Tilly's work, I define *food riots* as contentious collective action: a group of people assemble in a public place and raise the demand of lower food prices vis-à-vis another group of people.[^1] All case studies in this research project must conform to this basic definition of a specific *form* of action as well as a specific contentious *claim*. Based on empirical case studies I argue that such food riots form a *repertoire of contention* or "a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice".[^2]

- Thanks Till, it was a very good read!! I mainly have some comments about the use of your examples and clarifiying to the reader why you use which example when. You could also tie the narrative and analysis more closely back to the claims you announce in the beginning. You would then come stronger at the end where you summarize what you have shown. Thanks for letting it read!
- Up to here [until section on food riots and food prices] it is really exciting, well written, and with clear statements/theses. 
- Here you enter into an explanation of the presence of food riots in certain moments. You do not here, neither throughout the rest of the paper come back to the question of absence of food riots during other moments of high prices. You might want to flag this explicitly. I understand that explaining the presence in some moments sort of also explains the absence in others. Still, at this stage of the paper I was still thinking there might come a separate section to address specifically the reasons for absence during other times (I don't know, maybe particularly fearful times or a specifically good ruler…?), but you do not come back to that. 
- It is interesting that your account pays so little attention to individuals (leaders, charismatic people calling people to the riot, organizers, etc.). Just noting it. You at some point suggest that you just do not have much information on it, but then it might also be a theoretical choice. Still, one does wonder how these things came about and what role particular people played in deciding to start a riot.
- Here you are starting to lose me. The story is definitely interesting. But it is not so clear why we suddenly get so much detail. Why did you pick this incident to zoom in on? Why zoom in at all and give us the narrative? Where will you go with this and what exactly is it you are showing us with it? Why, for example, are you discussing the 13 August 1910 as well? What does it add over and above the incidents of the 11th of August? Make that explicit. 
- Hmm. This leaves the reader a bit disappointed. Are you saying that the previous narratives could have been left out from this paper that is more focused on establishing a set of features? Or are you saying that the one narrative was relevant to provide us one example and that unfortunately you cannot share with us all the other narratives of all the other incidents as they are actually all very interesting, but now you take this one in order to exemplify the common features that you distilled?
